              <br> This cuts out the corrupt middle-men and ensures that retailers purchase medicine from you, not counterfeiters.
              <br>
              <br> Moreover, its advanced nanotechnology resists replication. The number of people on earth that can create a
              glowing color-change solution is very limited, and many work on SafeStamp®.
              <br>
              <br> Not only will you capture back market share lost to fakes, you will differentiate your brand against substitutes
              and generics, which themselves could be counterfeit.</span>
